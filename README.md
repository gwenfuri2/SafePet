# SafePet

**SafePet** is a simple tool for pet owners to better understand what happens when their pets get into something they shouldn’t. It’s designed to help you quickly check how serious a situation might be—based on your pet’s species, weight, and what they may have eaten.

Right now, SafePet focuses on toxin lookups. You enter a few details about your pet and how much of a substance they may have ingested, and the app gives you an idea of the potential risk based on real veterinary thresholds.
